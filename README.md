**Ozone** sanitization, also known as ozonation, is a process in which ozone is introduced into a space in order to purify the air and surfaces of bacteria, viruses, mold, and other harmful contaminants. This can be done using an **ozonator**, a machine that generates **ozone** through the process of electrical discharge.
